Welcome to the Hairdresser Salon & Shop Application! This application is designed to streamline salon operations, manage appointments, and enhance customer experience. It serves as a comprehensive platform for both customers and salon staff, offering separate interfaces for each user group to meet their specific needs.

The frontend is implemented using Flutter, allowing for a seamless and responsive mobile application for customers. On the other hand, the backend is developed using ASP.NET, providing a robust and scalable foundation for handling business logic, data management, and communication between different components of the system.

Mobile Application (Customer Interface): Developed with Flutter, providing a user-friendly interface for customers to browse services, make appointments, and view their booking history.
Desktop Application (Admin and Hairdresser Interface): The desktop application is built for salon staff, with specific functionalities for admins and hairdressers to manage appointments, customer data, and other critical salon tasks.
The application utilizes design patterns in the backend to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility. These design patterns help create a structured and efficient backend system that can easily be extended with new features as the salon grows.
